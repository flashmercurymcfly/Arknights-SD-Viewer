# Arknights SD Viewer (Sparen Fork)

This is SparenofIr√≠a's fork of the Arknights SD Viewer repo. The main purpose of this fork is to provide animations for projects such as ArknightsDNH. There is no expectation of parity with the original repository. Parity additions will remain on the main gh-pages branch while all other changes will go in the sparen-dev branch.

## Python Scripts

- Commit Messages are used in the Changelog feature, which hooks into GitHub directly. Commit Messages should therefore be up to standard.
